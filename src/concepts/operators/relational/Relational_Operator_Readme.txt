Operators:
----------
		Relational operators are  <, <= , >=, >.


Property:
---------
1. 	We can apply relational operators for every primitive type except Boolean.
2.	We can’t apply relational operators for object types. As String is also an object we cann’t apply it over any String.
3. 	Nesting of relational operators is not allowed otherwise we will get compile time exception
