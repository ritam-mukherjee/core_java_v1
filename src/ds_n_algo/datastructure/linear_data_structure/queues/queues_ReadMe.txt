Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to stack. In contrast to stack, queue is opened at both end.
One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue).
Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.
